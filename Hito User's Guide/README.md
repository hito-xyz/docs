## I.  Your beta Hito wallet has limited functionality (for now) - here‚Äôs what you need to know: ##
        Supply chain issues have slowed receipt of different components and approvals with certain impacts 
        on your beta Hito user experience 

1.  **Manufactured in the USA:** Our shipment of * *Made in California | Founder‚Äôs Edition* * back panels has been delayed until January 6th. We therefore made the decision to ship your beta unit on time with prototype back panels which bear a Made in Berlin imprint, although your beta Htio wallet was assembled in San Francisco California.     
    - We will ship to all beta unit recipients a new Hito wallet with the Made in California|Founder‚Äôs Edition back panel beginning March 2023. 
2.  **Waterproofing:** the beta unit is not fully waterproof, your new Hito wallet shipped beginning March 2023 will be fully waterproof.
3.  **Software wallet support:** the beta Hito hardware wallet only works with the Hito App at the moment; it will support other software wallets in an upcoming firmware update
4.  **Transactions:** your beta Hito is safe and secure, but we strongly suggest your transact in small amounts with your beta Htio wallet until all firmware audits are complete. 
5.  **Product Review Embargo:** We welcome your user experience reports, questions, and suggestions in the Github repository. ** We ask that you refrain from any formal/comparative product and feature reviews of the beta Hito hardware wallet, and wait until you receive the fully functional first release version we will ship to you in March 2023 before publicizing your commentary. üôè
